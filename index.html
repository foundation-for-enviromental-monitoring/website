          <h1><a name="about">About</a></h1>
          <p><a href="http://ffem.io">Foundation for Environmental Monitoring (FFEM)</a>, is a nonprofit (Section 8) company based in Bangalore, India.</p>
          <p>We create products that are <strong>Open Source</strong>, <strong>Inexpensive</strong>, and <strong>Designed for field use</strong>. Our products are usually integrated with apps that post test results to online databases. We encourage results being posted as <strong>Open Data</strong>.</p>
          <p>Elements of our work begain 2012 as <a href="http://caddisfly.ternup.com">Ternup Research Labs</a>. In 2014, our team merged with <a href="http://akvo.org">Akvo</a>. FFEM was set up as a spinoff in June 2017. This <a href="http://akvo.org/blog/akvo-spins-off-environmental-sensor-organisation-ffem/">post</a> explains the context and future directions.</p>

          <h2>Water tests</h2>
          <p>Tests are for drinking water. These tests (except for Electrical Conductivity) are colorimetric tests that use a smaprtphone camera and flash to detect the contaminant. The electrical conductivity test works by attaching a probe to the USB port of a smartphone.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Fluoride</li>
            <li>Residual Chlorine</li>
            <li>pH</li>
            <li>Nitrate</li>
            <li>Phosphate</li>
            <li>Chromium</li>
            <li>Arsenic (Product development and validation underway)</li>
            <li>Coliforms / Fecal Coliforms (Product development underway)</li>
            <li>Electrical Conductivity (Preproduction)</li>
          </ul>
          <h2>Soil tests</h2>
          <p>Soil NPK and pH are strip tests / colorimetric test. Soil EC and Soil Moisture work by attaching probes to the USB port of a smartphone.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Soil NPK - Nitrogen, Phosphorous, and Potassium (Beta)</li>
            <li>Soil pH (Beta)</li>
            <li>Soil EC (Preproduction)</li>
