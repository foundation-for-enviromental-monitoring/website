Soil tests are required to estimate the plant-available concentrations of nutrients, in order to
determine fertilizer recommendations in agriculture.

### Need for a soil field test kit:
Soil testing is often performed by commercial labs that offer a variety of tests, targeting groups
of compounds and minerals. Soil chemistry changes over time, as biological and chemical
processes break down or combine compounds over time. As a result, the chemical composition
analysis accuracy can be improved if the soil is analysed soon after its extraction â€” usually
within a relative time period of 24 hours.

Soil tests often check for plant nutrients in three categories:
* **Major nutrients:** [Nitrogen (N)](#nitrogen), [Phosphorus (P)](#phosphorous), and [Potassium (K)](#phosphorous)
* **Secondary nutrients:** Sulphur (S), Calcium (Ca), Magnesium (Mg)
* **Minor nutrients:** Iron (Fe), Manganese (Mn), Copper (Cu), Zinc (Zn), Molybdenum (Mo),
Boron (B), Chlorine (Cl)
